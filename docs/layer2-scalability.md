# Layer-2 Scalability

## Overview
Layer-2 solutions enhance the scalability of blockchain networks by offloading transactions from the main chain, thereby reducing costs and increasing throughput.

## Optimistic Rollups
- **Optimistic Rollups**: Used to batch multiple transactions and settle them on the Ethereum main chain, allowing for higher throughput with lower gas fees.

## zk-Rollups
- **zk-Rollups**: A more advanced Layer-2 solution that uses zero-knowledge proofs to scale transactions securely without compromising on data integrity.

For implementation details, see the Layer-2 contracts and integration scripts in `/backend/blockchain/contracts` and `/backend/blockchain/integrations/layer2-integrations`.
